.SH NAME
.B Simple Shell
- Command language interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
./hsh
<command> <argument 1> <argument 2>
.SH DESCRIPTION
Simple shell is an sh-compatible command language interpreter
that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file.
The shell should work in interactive and non-interactive mode.

.SH PROMPT
When used interactively, the Simple Shell prompts
the value "$" before reading a command.

.SH COMMANDS
When the shell receives a line of text
it separates it into an array of strings containing
the first command and its following arguments.

.SH PATH
The Simple shell verifys if the first command is in fact a command.
When verified, the shell creates a child process using the function fork
and executes the given command in the child process using the function excev.

.SH ARGUMENTS
When the command is excecuted, the arguments given by the user are excecuted with the program using the function excev.

.SH EXCECUTION
Shell creates a child process to excecute the command and arguments,
while the child process excecutes the program, the parent process waits 
for the termination of the child.
if the excecution fails, a status is sent to the parent process, so the program can
finish correctly. A new prompt will be printed and the shell will be ready to receive
a new line of text from the user. 

.SH EXIT 
The shell receives two commands to exit correctly:
1. if the user types "exit", the shell will be terminated. 
2. if the user uses the CRL + d signal, the program will receive it as EOF and the shell will be terminated.
